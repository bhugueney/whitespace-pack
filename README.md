## Whitespace pack

This pack configures whitespace-mode so that it is useful and plays well with
the rest of Emacs Live.

### Configuration

whitespace-pack enables the following (in programming modes only):

* highlights trailing spaces
* highlights the ends of lines that go beyond 80 characters
* highlights tabs anywhere they appear
* cleans up whitespace when a buffer is written to disk
